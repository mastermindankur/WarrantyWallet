  // --- Placeholder for Secure Multi-User Warranty Fetching ---
  //
  // The logic to fetch warranties for ALL users cannot be securely implemented here
  // without the Firebase Admin SDK. The client-side SDK is sandboxed by security
  // rules and cannot act as a "superuser".
  //
  // A proper implementation would involve:
  // 1. Using a secure, server-only environment (like a dedicated backend service or a
  //    Google Cloud Function).
  // 2. Initializing the Firebase Admin SDK in that environment with service account credentials.
  // 3. Querying the 'warranties' collection for documents where the expiry date is near.
  // 4. For each expiring warranty found, calling an email service (like Resend) to
  //    send a reminder to the associated user's email.
  //
  // This endpoint serves as the trigger, but the core work must be done elsewhere.
